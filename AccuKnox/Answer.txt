
#Question 1: By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? 

Django signals are executed synchronously. This means 
the signal handlers are executed immediately as the signal is sent, and 
the sender has to wait for the handler to finish before proceeding.

#Question 2: Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller?

Yeah, by default, Django signals are executed in the same thread as the 
caller. Since the signal handlers are executed synchronously, they run 
in the same thread unless you manually run them in a different one.

#Question 3: By default do django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller?

Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. If 
the caller transaction fails, the signal handler actions are also rolled
back.
